- 👋 Hi, I’m @BjornTheProgrammer
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and programming microcontrollers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code an operating system
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project [BERDOS](https://github.com/BERDPhone/BERDOS)

Additionally I'm working on tools to help make programming the Raspberry Pi Pico much easier, I'm working on a tool called [Pico-Online](https://github.com/BERDPhone/BERDOS), which is a functional way of programming the Raspeberry Pi Pico remotely, with UART output and breakpoints (still working on that)! It currently works, and I'm adding new features every week. It is meant to be hassle free to install and customize.
